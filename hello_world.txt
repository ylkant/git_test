Hell o' world
One could get a whiff of the horrendousness of war
Humans starving
Guilt-free folks being slaughtered
daily dose of unemployment
house DEMOLITIONS
ignorance thrives on
We have no idea of how much we suffer
anyway livin' hell o' world
Knowingly livin' hell o' world
probably livin' hell o' world
